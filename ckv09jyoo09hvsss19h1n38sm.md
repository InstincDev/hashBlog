## 100DaysOfCode using FreeCodeCamp - Week 4


# I got my first FCC certification!

The final two projects for the course were to create a  [Technical Documentation](https://codepen.io/instincdev/pen/WNEboWG)  page and a  [Personal Portfolio](https://codepen.io/instincdev/pen/WNErGKd) .  These projects provided me additional practice with CSS Grid and Flexbox.  They also helped me to gain a better understanding of CSS measurement units - pixels, ems, rems, and percents.

I have been learning to code for a little over a year now; however, creating my first portfolio page is an accomplishment of which I am especially proud.

## I Did It!

It took me longer than expected, (see [week 3 recap](https://instincdev.hashnode.dev/100daysofcode-using-freecodecamp-week-3)) but I have finally completed FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design curriculum.

Due to continued health issues and the subsequent inability to work on the computer, this week's recap is posted a week late.  Nevertheless, the delays and struggles make obtaining this certification even more significant.

## Next Week

I have begun FCC's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum.  My goal for next week to work on the Basic JS course as well as to create HTML / CSS web designs.
