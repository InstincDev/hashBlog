## 100DaysOfCode using FreeCodeCamp - Week 11

Yup, I am still working through Intermediate Algorithm Scripting.

So, in this article, I will discuss how to make it through these problems -  when you don't know where to start.

## Intermediate Algorithm Scripting

First, I carefully read through the problem.  Sometimes, multiple readings are required to ensure I understand what I am expected to do.

Next, I run through how I might solve the problem. If I come up with a clear plan of action (or at least part of one), I try it out.

If it works ... Great!
![Yes!](https://media.giphy.com/media/Z97CalNlWHQNTdVSZ7/giphy-downsized-large.gif)

If it does not ...
![OOPS!](https://media.giphy.com/media/80TEu4wOBdPLG/giphy.gif)

I use the Get Help / Get A Hint button and review the hints and provided solutions.

As soon as I see that what I am doing is not working, I search for help. This way, I am not stuck wasting hours working on the wrong thing.

Often, one of the suggested solutions is similar to the plan that I had to solve the problem.

Next, I review the suggested solution, taking note of each part to make sure I understand it.

Then, I add any unfamiliar methods or properties to my Anki deck for later study. ([How I study with Anki](https://instincdev.hashnode.dev/100daysofcode-using-freecodecamp-week-10))

Once I have a basic understanding of all the concepts, I return to the problem and try to solve it on my own.

## Next Week

So now, with just a few more Intermediate Algorithm Scripting lessons left and continued study, I think that I am ready to tackle the 'more difficult' JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects.
