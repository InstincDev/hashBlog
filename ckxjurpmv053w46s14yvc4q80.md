## 100DaysOfCode using FreeCodeCamp - Week 13

I finished the 5 JavaScript projects and earned the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification!

## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects#

> This is it — time to put your new JavaScript skills to work. These projects are similar to the algorithm scripting challenges you've done before – just much more difficult.

The final 5 projects were:
* Palindrome Checker
* Roman Numeral Converter
* Caesar's Cipher
* Telephone Number Validator
* Cash Register


The [Palindrome Checker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/palindrome-checker) focused on manipulation of a given string that the algorithm must check and return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>, ignoring punctuation and spacing.

The [Roman Numeral Converter](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/roman-numeral-converter) required the converting of numerals into a string based on information contained within an array.

[Caesar's Cipher](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/caesars-cipher) is a project that I had previously completed in Python; however, completing it in JS required a slightly different type of algorithmic thinking.  For this project, a function must be created that takes an encoded string and returns a decoded string using an ROT13 cipher.

The [Telephone Number Validator](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/telephone-number-validator) requires that a string, in the form of a US phone number, must be validated, returning <code> true</code> or <code> false</code> based on a combination of various formats. For this project, I used a site called [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/), which allows you to create and test regular expressions.

Finally, the [Cash Register](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects/cash-register) project requires the creation of a cash register drawer that takes 3 arguments: a purchase price, payment amount, and the cash in the drawer.  The function(s) must return an object containing a status key and a change key. This project had the most lines of code of almost any other project. I spent multiple hours debugging and struggling to pass the various test cases.

This curriculum has helped me to think and examine problems in ways that I never had before. There were many times that I thought I would not make it through to the end, but now that I have, I am even more proud of my accomplishment.
