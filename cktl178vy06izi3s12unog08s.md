## Just Keep Writing

I came across hashnode while researching the best blogging platforms for programmers.  In the end it was...

by @[Adrian Twarog](@adriantwarog) and his subsequent tweet about the hashnode bootcamp that persuaded me to signup for both... and I am so glad that I did!

The bootcamp began with keynote speaker @[Quincy Larson](@quinc), founder of FreeCodeCamp.  He provided many tips on how to start writing and get noticed. Additionally, he spoke on the personal, professional, and community benefits of technical writing.  Hearing from an industry leader that there is 'room for everyone' because everyone's perspective is unique was inspiring.

The main speaker was @[Edidiong Asikpo](@didicodes). Her presentation of *Getting Started with Technical Writing * gave an in-depth explanation of what technical writing is and how to perfect the skill. She also explained that even though someone is born with a skill, unless it is cultivated and practiced, it will not develop.  Some of her tips to getting started include:

* Taking a technical writing course
* Read
* Write
* Stay Consistent

# Key Takeaway

The common theme from both of the speakers is not to write to get noticed.  Remember that followers will come with time, but until then, just keep writing.
