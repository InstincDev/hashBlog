## 100DaysOfCode using FreeCodeCamp - Week 2

Another week completed, and another week closer to completing 100DaysOfCode using FreeCodeCamp (FCC).  This week, I accomplished the goals I set last week to complete the Responsive Web Design lessons and begin working on the projects for the certification.

The courses I completed this week include:

* Responsive Web Design Principles
* CSS Flexbox
* CSS Grid

##  [Responsive Web Design Principles](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#responsive-web-design-principles) 

>Responsive web design is the practice of designing flexible websites that can respond to different screen sizes, orientations, and resolutions. - FCC

The 4 lessons of this course introduce the concepts of media queries, high resolution display manipulation, as well as image and text responsiveness.

##  [CSS Flexbox](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#css-flexbox) 

>With flexbox, it's easy to center elements on the page and create dynamic user interfaces that shrink and expand automatically. - FCC

There are 17 lessons in this course. Each lesson is designed to teach the application of a specific flex property.  The FCC's interactive lessons were very useful, as they allowed me to not only apply the flex properties to a sample Twitter card, but also change the property values to see the differences between them.

##  [CSS Grid](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#css-grid) 

>The CSS grid is a newer standard that makes it easy to build complex responsive layouts. - FCC

Like the CSS Flexbox lessons, FCC's 22 grid lessons allowed me to practice changing an item's alignment by alternating between grid property values. 

## Next Week

My goal for next week is to complete the Responsive Web Design projects and receive my first FCC certification.  I will also be posting articles breaking down the development process for each of the projects. So stay tuned for those!
