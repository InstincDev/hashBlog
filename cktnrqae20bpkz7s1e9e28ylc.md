## Discipline Is A B*tch

For me, one of the hardest parts of writing is the actual sitting down to do it.  During the day, I may come up with hundreds of ideas and topics to write about, but when it finally comes time to write, I get filled with a sense of dread and fear.

Don't get me wrong! I love to write!  But, sometimes the requirement to write is intimidating.  Nevertheless, blogging requires consistency, consistency takes discipline, and as we all know...

Because of this and many more facts, @[Chris Bongers](@dailydevtips) was the perfect speaker for Day 2 of the Hashnode bootcamp.  During his speech on *Article Ideas and Consistency*, Chris acknowledges some of the reasons people fail when it comes to writing:

* Life
* Schedule
* Content Traction
* Lack of Effort
* Writer's Block

I have to admit that, at one point or another, I have fallen victim to one or more of these examples during my writing journey.  During these times, discipline becomes the most frustrating, and yet important skill to exercise.

By employing discipline, writing becomes more consistent and personally rewarding, as well as more interesting for readers.  Chris also gave a few tips on how to become more consistent: Plan Ahead, Set Realistic Goals, Motivate and Inspire Yourself, and then Celebrate Every Milestone.

# Key Takeaway

The main key from this bootcamp is that being disciplined to a task can be difficult at the onset, but it is often very rewarding upon completion.
