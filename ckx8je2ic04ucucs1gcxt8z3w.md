## 100DaysOfCode using FreeCodeCamp - Week 12

## I am DONE!

After 3 long weeks, I am finally done with **Intermediate Algorithm Scripting**!

All of these lessons were difficult, but the last few were just plan HARD. (I'm looking at you Steamroller.)

Here is a review of some of the methods I found most helpful while working through these lessons.

```
.concat()
merges two or more arrays, doesnt change existing arrays, returns new array

.some()
returns true if, in the array, an element for the provided function
returns true; otherwise it returns false; doesn't modify array 

.every()
tests if all elements in array pass a test implemented by a provided function

.parseInt()
parses a string and returns the first integer, a radix specifies
the number system to use

.split()
divides a String into an ordered list of substrings, puts these
substrings into an array, and returns the array.

.slice()
returns a copy of elements from the original array into a new array

.splice()
changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing
elements and/or adding new elements

.findIndex()
returns the index of the first element in the array that returns a
callback function of true, if no element is found returns -1 

String.fromCharCode()
returns a string created from the specified sequence of UTF-16 code units

Array.isArray()
determines whether the passed value is an array

.map()
creates a new array populated with the results of calling a
provided function on every element in the calling array

.filter()
creates a new array with all elements that pass the test
implemented by the provided function.

.reverse()
reverses an array 

.reduce()
executes a callback function on each element of the array, in order,
passing in the value from the calculation on the preceding element,
resulting in a single value.
```

A good understanding of [arrow methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_function),  [getters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get),  [setters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set),  [recursion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Recursion),  and  the [details of the object model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Details_of_the_Object_Model) is also helpful.

In addition to finishing Intermediate Algorithm Scripting, I completed 2 of the 5 final JS projects this week:

    * Palindrome Checker
    * Roman Numeral Converter

## Next Week

Next week, I hope to complete projects:
      * Caesar's Cipher
      * Telephone Number Validation
      * Cash Register

~ Thus, earning the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification!
