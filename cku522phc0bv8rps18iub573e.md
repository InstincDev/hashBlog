## Hashnode Bootcamp: Don't Worry About The Numbers

Being self-taught and still relatively new to the tech community, I underestimated the power and necessity of social media (SM) from a professional stantpoint.

On the final day of Hashnodes Technical Writing Bootcamp, @[Katherine Peterson](@katherinecodes) spoke about * How To Increase Your Professional Network On Social Media *.

## Getting Started

The first step to increasing your SM presence is to create an account.  When choosing which SM platform to join, @[Katherine](@katherinecodes) suggests considering: 

* which platform best fits your personality
*  which platform best fits your niche
* how much time you have to commit to the platform

A popular starting platform is Twitter.  Even it you already have a Twitter account, it is beneficial to create another that is solely focused on your professional brand.  For more information on creating your brand, check out  [Give Then Ask](https://instincdev.hashnode.dev/hashnode-bootcamp-give-then-ask)  in this series.

## What To Post?

Once you have created your account, share the projects you are working on.  Remember, everything you create can be turned into content.  Additionally, you can post: 

* Original Content
* Personal Insights
* Questions
* Help Requests

It is important to show your personality and engage with others.

## How To Make Connections?

* Show Interest In Others
* Cultivate Relationships
* Engage With Individuals Of Various Skill Levels

Joining Twitter and becoming an active member of the tech Twitter community has multiple benefits. Twitter is currently the number one way to find a job in tech.  Other professional opportunities -  such as speaking at podcasts, live-streams, and conferences - are also made possible through this SM platform.  Another benefit of engaging on tech Twitter is gaining friends, supporters, and mentors. 

## Takeaway

@[Katherine](@katherinecodes) reminds you that the quality of your relationships are more important than the quantity.

> ### Don't Worry About The Numbers.

Be professional, but remember SM is supposed to be fun.  So, enjoy yourself, and don't take it too seriously!
