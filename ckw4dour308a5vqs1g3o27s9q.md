## Basic Algorithmic Scripting
>An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something. To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts and think carefully about how to solve each part with code. -FCC

This was my first time actively working on algorithm scripting. I spent many hours researching and implementing various possible solutions.  It was a challenge! 

Nevertheless, I kept trying, and in the end, I learned a lot. Such as, to rely on built-in JS functions more than loops to solve the problems. In doing so, I also created much cleaner code. 

Once I had finally correctly written the algorithms, I gained even more insight into the problems by using the lessons Hint pg. to see how others had solved the same problem.

## Object Oriented Programming
>OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is one of the major approaches to the software development process. In OOP, objects and classes organize code to describe things and what they can do. -FCC

The OOP course continued where the Data Structures course ended.  I created basic objects, properties, and constructors. The lessons also introduced the concepts of prototype chains and inheritance. During the final lessons, I learned about Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) and how they are used in a module.

## Next Week

* Functional Programming - 😊 more functions!!
* Intermediate Algorithm Scripting - 😨

These are the last 2 courses before I begin the JS Projects!
