## 100DaysOfCode using FreeCodeCamp

I have completed the first week of #100DaysOfCode using FreeCodeCamp!

This one hour coding challenge has created a much needed, calming sense of accomplishment.  Yes, I (usually) complete more than one task in a day.  I also (usually) code for more than one hour.  Nevertheless, I am completing this challenge not only to learn new coding concepts and frameworks, but also to learn to appreciate small victories and how far I have come over the last couple of years.

At the beginning of this week, I started the Responsive Web Design Certification.  The courses that I completed this week include:
 
* Basic HTML and HTML5
* Basic CSS
* Applied Visual Design
* Applied Accessibility

These were very easy, quick, and simple to understand lessons aimed at easing the user into coding.  I enjoyed the interactive aspect of the lessons, as well as the ability to essentially build and manipulate an application during the process.

Having grown accustomed to using the code editor *Visual Studio Code*, I greatly missed having an autocomplete feature.  However, having to type every element is very good practice for a beginner.  This practice also forces a not-so-beginner to pay increased attention to syntax errors.

My goal for next week is to complete the Responsive Web Design lessons and begin working on the projects for this certification.
