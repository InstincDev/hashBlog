##  [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)  🔐📝

If you do anything online, chances are you have used an Auth0 service.  Auth0 provides identity logins for thousands of companies in over 70 countries.  Their blog contains up-to-date information on how to utilize their technologies in multiple programming languages.  Auth0 is also one of the sponsors of Hasnode's Technical Writing Bootcamp. It was this bootcamp, hosted by @[Sam Sycamore](@tanoaksam), that 'prompted' me to write this post!

If you are looking to "secure" a job in technical writing, check out Auth0's **[Apollo Program](https://auth0.com/apollo-program)**!

Hasnode's Writing bootcamp was also sponsored by Vercel. Vercel is a platform that allows developers to create frontend static sites using templates optimized for specific frameworks.
