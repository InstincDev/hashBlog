## 100DaysOfCode using FreeCodeCamp - Week 5

# Bye Bye HTML & CSS (for now😄) Hello JavaScript!

In week four, I completed FCC's Responsive Web Design curriculum and began JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.

## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
> In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions. Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station. Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).
-FCC

The curriculum consists of the following courses, scripting challenges, and projects:

* Basic JavaScript
* ES6
* Regular Expressions
* Debugging
* Basic Data Structures
* Basic Data Algorithm Scripting
* Object Oriented Programming
* Functional Programing
* Intermediate Algorithm Scripting
* JavaScript Algorithms & Data Structures Projects

### Basic JavaScript
> In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more.
-FCC

This week I completed the Basic JavaScript (JS) lessons.  There are over 100 lessons in this course.  I completed them in daily sections of around 20%.

Working through the lessons gave me a clear perspective of what I knew and where I needed more work.  For example, I can now say that I have a firm understanding of how and when to use switch case. However, with recursion, I am just beginning to understand the how, but not so much the when.

Included in the Basic JS lessons are 7 practice problems that provide a glimpse of the "in the wild" application of some topics being taught. However, once the tests are run, very little explanation is given as to why the test did or did not pass. For this reason, I found that using ```console.log()``` (especially on the arrays and objects problems) really helped me to gain a better understanding of what was going on under the hood.


## Next Week

Next week, I plan to continue the JS courses, ES6 and Regular Expressions 😱.
