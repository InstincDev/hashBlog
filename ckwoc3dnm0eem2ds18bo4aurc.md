## 100DaysOfCode using FreeCodeCamp - Week 10

This week, I learned the importance of studying. After the first few days of frustration, I took a break from FCC's Intermediate Algorithm Scripting course, and instead, I focused on retaining information through effective study techniques.

## Take a break.... and Study!

### Study Techniques

The two main studying methods that I have been using are spaced repetition and active recall.

* **Spaced Repetition** is spacing out study sessions over periods of hours, days, weeks, and months so that information is effectively moved from short term memory into long term memory.

* **Active Recall** is the act of stimulating your mind to remember as much about a topic
without any other outside sources such as notes or text.

The following videos by  [Ali Abdaal](https://www.youtube.com/c/aliabdaal/featured) highlight the benefits of these scientifically proven techniques.

### Anki

Anki is an online flashcard app that utilizes spaced repetition and active recall to maximize information retention.  Users can create or download pre-made decks of varying flashcard types, including front-question / back-answer, fill-in-the-blank, and much more.  This app also allows for audio and images to be added to the cards.

I downloaded a HTML, CSS, and JS deck, as well as created a deck of flashcards for each of the built-in JS functions I have covered.  For example:

Reviewing these cards help me to actively recall the information I have learned, and the Anki app automatically spaces them out so that I will retain the information.


## Next Week

Only 4 more weeks to go!

Next week I plan to continue creating and using my Anki decks and working to complete FCC's Intermediate Algorithm Scripting.
