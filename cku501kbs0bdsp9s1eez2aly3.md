## Django vs. Flask: Comparing Python Frameworks

Which Python framework should you use for your next project? This article breaks down the differences between two of the most poplar Python frameworks, Django and Flask.

##  [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/start/overview/) 

Django is an extremely popular opensource Python framework.  This framework was developed to provide users with almost everything they may want and / or need in order  to quickly create secure, maintainable websites.  Each Django component is independent and able to be changed, creating full scalability for increased website traffic.  

While Django is great for developing larger websites, due to its multitude of features, it may be considered "overkill" for smaller sites.  One disadvantage of Django is that it has a steep learning curve. It may be difficult for new coders, as some web development knowledge is required.  Some sites that use Django include: Instagram, Mozilla, Pinterest, and Disqus.

|Advantages|Features|Use If|
|------------:|:---------:|:----------:|
|Advanced Features|Model-Template-View |Well-Versed in Python|
|SEO Optimized|Databases|Using Dynamic HTML Pages|
|Versatile|Access|SQL Databases|
|Default Security Features|Sessions|Creating Large Sites|
|Highly Scalable|Monolithic Working Style|
|Batteries-Included|

##  [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) 

Flask is a popular opensource microframework, meaning it provides users with only the basics of what is needed to create a website.  This minimalisation gives users the freedom to choose which libraries they want to use.  The Flask community provides multiple extensions, which make it possible to add functionality with ease. 

Flask is ideal for small applications and static websites. It is easy to set up, and very little web development knowledge is needed. However, as more features are added, Flask may become more difficult. Some sites that use Flask include: Airbnb, Netflix, Lyft, and Reddit.

| Advantages| Features | Use If|
