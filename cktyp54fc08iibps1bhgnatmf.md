## Hashnode Bootcamp: We Are At A Buffet

"How do I make money as a technical writer?"  This is one of the first and most repeated questions asked by writers. On day 5 of Hashnode's Technical Writing bootcamp, @[Shaquil Hansford](@ShaquilHansford) provided some  hard truths about writing monetization.

## Hard Truths = Experience Distilled Into Words

In the field of technology, experience is gold.  Like gold, experience is gained either through hard work or as a gift. The gift of experience comes in the form of hard truths.

@[Shaquil](@ShaquilHansford) explained that training your mind to accept hard truths is the most important aspect preparing for job opportunities. Five hard truths of the tech field are: 

1. What Works Is NOT What Should Work
2. Branding Matters
3. Networking Matters
4. Double Down On Your Strengths 
5. Sell Yourself

### What Works Is NOT What Should Work

People should not have to create a brand, continuously network, and showcase their work in order to get the attention of an employer.  Why can't they just apply for a job, show what they can do, and get hired? Because, it is no secret that life is not fair.  The secret is, however, that getting hired is a process.  If you accept this hard truth and put in the work, you will get hired.

### Branding Matters

Your brand should be the first thing that people associate with you.  Everyone is going to form an opinion of you; so be clear about who you are and what you do.  All of your social media bios should state that you are a tech writer.  Additionally, the majority of your posts and conversations should be related to tech writing.  When people think of you, it should be 'that's *insert name* they are a tech writer.' 

### Networking Matters

Once you have created your brand, it is time to make your presence known.  If you want to succeed in the digital world, you have to *be* in the digital world.  You need to follow and interact with other tech writers in open online spaces such as Twitter.  Starting with one social media platform:
 
* Create posts about your current projects
* Check out what others are working on
* Become an active member of the community

Networking will increase the potential for you to be referred by someone for a job.  For more tips on branding and networking, check out article 3 of this series: [Hashnode Bootcamp: Give Then Ask](https://instincdev.hashnode.dev/give-then-ask).

### Double Down On Your Strengths

Are you an engineer that can write, or a writer that understands engineering? Identify what you are best at, and do that.  As @[Shaquil](@ShaquilHansford) states, "Sharpen your biggest sword."  Once you have identified your greatest strength, create a portfolio of your best work.

### Sell Yourself

Now it is time to show off.  Use your 'biggest sword' and sell your skills to potential clients and employers.  People often do not have the time to look through your entire portfolio.  Your qualifications may be judged by one article, so make it good. 

## Job Opportunities

Once you have mentally accepted and worked to fulfill the above hard truths, now it is time to search for a job. While @[Shaquil](@ShaquilHansford) provided multiple tips on how to look for jobs, the main tip is to research sources that provide multiple opportunities, such as:

* Well Known Tech Companies
* Lesser Known Tech Companies
* Non-Web Related Companies

Medical, Education, Gaming - nearly every field has a need for technical writers.  In terms of demand, @[Shaquil](@ShaquilHansford) states:

### " We Are At A Buffet."

What topic do you already have knowledge of and are passionate about? Think outside the box. Be choosy and put together the perfect meal.

## Takeaways

@[Shaquil](@ShaquilHansford) advises, even if you are not feeling good enough, and putting in the work sucks; force your way through it and do it anyway.  Accepting the hard truths about the hiring process is key to making money as a tech writer.
