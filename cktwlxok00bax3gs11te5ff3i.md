## 100DaysOfCode using FreeCodeCamp

# Series Introduction

I will be completing the 100DaysOfCode challenge using FreeCodeCamp. In doing so, I will practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.  This series will be a documented roadmap of my learning journey. 

## 100DaysOfCode

The 100DaysOfCode challenge was developed by Alex Kallaway as a means of providing participants with the opportunity to cultivate a daily habit of learning and coding.  The challenge rules require participants to code at least one hour, for one hundred consecutive days.  Each day the participants must tweet their progress using #100DaysOfCode and interact with at least two other challenge participants.  In doing so, participants are encouraged to:

* Focus on learning advanced topics
* Interact with other learners and like-minded individuals
* Build portfolio projects
* Decrease the fear of sharing projects online

## FreeCodeCamp

FreeCodeCamp is a non-profit learning platform, developed by @[Quincy Larson](@quincy), to teach people about coding and technology.  The FreeCodeCamp curriculum consists of multiple certifications ranging from Responsive Web Design to Machine Learning, and from Data Visualization to Interview Prep.  Each certification is broken down into 300 hours worth of courses and projects.  FreeCodeCamp's YouTube channel provides numerous videos that correspond to course topics, some of which are designed to allow students to follow along with the course lessons. 


## My Personal Goal
My ultimate goal for this challenge is to come as close as possible to obtaining FreeCodeCamp certificates in Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, and Front End Development Libraries.  I will be posting my progress daily on twitter @[instincdev](https://twitter.com/instincdev) and adding weekly recaps to this series every Wednesday.
