## 100DaysOfCode using FreeCodeCamp - Week 7

I am half way through my 100DaysOfCode!

I am also half way through FCC's JavaScript (JS) Algorithms and Data Structures curriculum!

This week I completed the Debugging and Basic Data Structures courses.

## Debugging
> Debugging is the process of going through your code, finding any issues, and fixing them. - FCC

This course introduced how to use the JS console as well as to identify and correct the most common types of coding errors:

* syntax - such as Forgotten Parentheses, Brackets, Braces, and Quotes
* runtime -  such as Infinite Loops
* logical - such as Off By One Errors

During this course, one of my favorite debugging tools was also introduced, `console.log()`.

## Basic Data Structures
> In this Basic Data Structures course, you'll learn about the differences between arrays and objects, and which to use in different situations. -FCC

### Arrays
The first half of this course focused on storing and manipulating data within simple and multi-dimensional arrays.  The lessons provided me with practice utilizing bracket notation and various JS methods.  For example:

``` javascript
push() // adds element to the end of array;
pop() // removes element from end of array
shift() // removes first element from array
unshift() // adds element to beginning of array
slice() // returns a copy of array using (start, end) parameters, end not inclusive 
splice() // removes and replaces array elements using (start, deleteCount, newElements) parameters 
```

### Objects

The Basic Data Structures course introduced the concept of JS objects. (A more in-depth look into object oriented programming is covered in a later course.)  Within these lessons, I practiced modifying, removing, checking the existence of, and iterating over key-value pairs using dot and bracket notation, JS methods, and for ... in loops.

## Next Week

Next week, I hope to complete another 2 courses -
* Basic Algorithm Scripting
* Object Oriented Programming
